Well, for those who don't know what "The Schedule" is, it's simply a revision schedule for the upcoming (March 2014; 4 more months) examinations. With that examinations completes my metriculation and I can go into a college. And "The Schedule" is one organized by our school. While all these seem very common, "The Schedule" actually isn't, at least for me.

The Schedule started on 30th of October. By "The Schedule", I refer to the 3 revision schedules, 3 pre-final examinations and the pre-public examination.

### How it goes on.

Well, first and foremost, I reach school by 7:45 am for which I will be picked up by my private van at 7 am, which is a 45 min. journey, picking up 4 others along the way. At last I reach school in time, at 7:45 am, of course. Then starts the school prayer *(I never really prayed)* followed by meditation. And it'll be 8:15 by the time we reach the classrooms.

Following this are the examinations. There will be 3 exams a day. And the time table for it is somewhat like this:

 * 8:15am - 9:30 am : Learning for Exam-1
 * 9:30am - 10:30 am : Exam-1
 * 10:30am - 10:40 pm : Short break
 * 10:40am - 12:30 pm : Learning for Exam-2
 * 12:30am - 1:00 pm : Lunch Break
 * 1:00pm - 2:00 pm : Exam-2
 * 2:00pm - 3:30 pm : Learning for Exam-3
 * 3:30pm - 4:30 pm : Exam-3
 * 4:40pm - 5:45 pm : Error Rectification

While that seems cool and easy, it isn't. Those one-and-a-half-hour learning times are actually really short. OH: And Error Rectification time : I actually love it! (When I don't do any errors in the exams)

And oh, forgot to tell you. They won't leave you even though you're in home. Here's the timetable for it:

 * 6:45pm - 7:15 pm : Home Work
 * 7:15 - 10:00 pm : Learning / Practising for the exams next day

And another *wow* thing is that you have you wake up by 5:00am and start... well, doing whatever you want. I'm still waiting for this deadly schedule to be finished quickly and OH: Time *is* passing quickly.
